# DABOT: Disaster Attention Bot

Since [September 19th, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Central_Mexico_earthquake) ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/sep/20/mexico-city-earthquake-dozens-dead-powerful-quake-live-updates), [CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/19/americas/mexico-earthquake/index.html)), and the following dates in which Mexico has faced several earthquakes, I've been wondering how could reports of damaged zones, people buried under rests of building, injuried people in need of medicines and other situations could be handled.

What was created by that time, "[Verificado 19s](http://www.verificado19s.org/)", was an immediate solution to follow up reports from social media and visualize the info on a map embeded in a website. The thing is that there were a lot of people that were all the time monitoring posts (of people, in real time) of all social media and the data was updated every ~10 minutes.

I've been thinking about trying to optimize this process for future situations, not only for earthquakes, but for other natural disasters. This is why I'm trying to create a solution for this, and wanted to work specifically in this bot.
